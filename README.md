It's very simple, but useful "tool" for recording some event at the time you will set **(\*o\*)**
You can use it very easy **(~^b^)~**

Let's go to the "params.json":
1. Set path to OBS Studio (for example *"C:\ProgramFiles\obs-studio\bin\64bit\obs64.exe"*). I hope you do it **(^v^)**
2. Set time of begining and ending your event (it's like this -> *\[hours : minutes : seconds\]*). Easy, right **(O.o)**? Let's continue...
3. Now you need to **launch OBS Studio** and set the same hotkey for *"Start Recording"* and *"End Recording"* (it's very important, because the program don't know which key start and finish recording). Also you need to change parameter at the file too **(>vo)**

I think you did it **(\~^b^)\~**

Save this file and start "main.py". The 10 minutes before event, a program will launch an OBS, and if you want you can change some settings. 
Wait a little bit... Hooray!!! The recording is begining! Also recording will finish at time you set!
Like it! Good **\~(^o^)\~**
